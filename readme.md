## 01_WebScraping_FIFA21_8min
- A simple code to collect data (FIFA 21 - 8min Battles) from one website with different pages. After collect pages, it saves one .CSV file with structured data (dataset).

## 02_MachineLearning_VotingClassifier_FraudDetection
- This study shows how to predict fraud (highly unbalanced data) using SMOTE as a resampling strategy and Voting Classifier to calculate probabilities. I used LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier to feed the Voting Classifier.

## 03_NLP_TextClassification
1. (01_TextClassification4Categories_NLP_ML) This study presents one way to build a model to do text classification (I used the 20 newsgroups dataset). As feature extraction strategy, I extracted TF-IDF vectors of tokens.
2. (02_SpamDetector_NLTK_ML) This study focus on building a binary classification model to detect which text messages are spam or not.  As feature extraction strategy, I extracted TF-IDF vectors of tokens from lemmatisation.
3. (03_ReviewClassification_KERAS_DeepLearning) This study build a deep learning model with keras for amazon reviews. Using Bidirectional LSTM model, which is complex network and very well-known to achieve great metrics when talking about text classification, I got a great predictor of review's sentiment.

## 04_ClusteringAnalysis
1. (01_ImageClassification_ConvNet_DeepLearning_cifar10) I implemented functions required to build a deep learning model to clasify imagens into 10 categories (I used Cifar10 dataset). It is a good way to learn how ConvNet can be used.

## 05_ClusteringAnalysis
1. (01_ClusterAnalysis_SKlearn_MethodExamples) I implemented functions required to use clustering algorithm (K-Means, DBSCAN, BIRCH, Agglomerative clustering, Dendrogram). I used mainly scikit-learn package.
