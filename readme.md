## 01_WebScraping_FIFA21_8min
- A simple code to collect data (FIFA 21 - 8min Battles) from one website with different pages. After collect pages, it saves one .CSV file with structured data (dataset).

## 02_MachineLearning_VotingClassifier_FraudDetection
- This study shows how to predict fraud (highly unbalanced data) using SMOTE as a resampling strategy and Voting Classifier to calculate probabilities. I used LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier to feed the Voting Classifier.

## 03_DeepLearning_NLP_SpamDetection
- This study presents one way to build a model to do text classification (I used the 20 newsgroups dataset). As feature extraction strategy, I extracted TF-IDF vectors of tokens.
